        <p>Last Updated: February 4, 2026</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Nature of the Service</h2>
            <p><strong>Platform is a UI Only.</strong> This interface is provided by a Cayman Islands Foundation ("The Foundation") solely as a user interface (UI) to interact with decentralized smart contracts. The Foundation does not operate a digital asset exchange, broker-dealer, or custodian. The interface provides a visual way to access the blockchain, but all transactions occur directly on-chain.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Non-Custodial Service</h2>
            <p><strong>User Control of Keys.</strong> The Service is strictly non-custodial. We do not have access to your private keys, seed phrases, or funds at any time. You maintain full control and ownership of your assets. You are solely responsible for the security of your wallet and private keys. If you lose access to your wallet, the Foundation cannot recover your funds.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. No Investment Advice or Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>No Guarantee of Profit.</strong> The Foundation makes no representation or warranty that using this interface or interacting with the underlying smart contracts will result in any profit. The use of this interface is at your own risk.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="risk-warning">
            <strong>RISK DISCLOSURE:</strong> Crypto assets are volatile. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The value of digital assets can fluctuate significantly, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Please conduct your own due diligence before interacting with any smart contract.
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Foundation shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the interface.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
